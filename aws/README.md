# AWS Chainlink setup

This folder contains all things related to setting up a chainlink node
on AWS.

If you are new to AWS, you'll need to setup an AWS account. Then the
recommended order for proceeding with these docs would be:

1. [vpc.md](./vpc.md)
2. [rds.md](./rds.md)
3. [elastic_beanstalk.md](./elastic_beanstalk.md)
