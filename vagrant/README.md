This folder contains documentation related to running a Chainlink node
with Vagrant's Ubuntu 18.0.4 box (bionic) on your computer.

This documentation will suit you if you want to:

- Run a local Chainlink node with Ubuntu
- Learn how to set up virtual machine with Vagrant
- Speed up Chainlink node boot process
- Look up tips & tricks for Ubuntu (or linux machines in general)

It is highly recommended, that you do learning and experimentation
on a virtual machine, so you can avoid harming your computer and/or your
production environment.

Virtual machines also help you imitate your production environments
better and help segregate personal stuff from work/development stuff
on your computer.

If you're just getting started, you should start with
[vagrant_ropsten.md](vagrant_ropsten.md) and then continue on
to [vagrant_tips.md](vagrant_tips.md).
